# Tell me about yourself



# 2.

* Thank You sir/ma'am for giving this opportunity to introduce myself, I am Tannu Kumari, currently I am pursuing B tech from University College of Engineering and Technology Vinoba Bhave University in Information technolgy.

* Currently I am interning with Bank of New york Mellon and there I am Working on Spring and Spring boot based projects, working with build tools such as Maven, I have migrated 3 projects from java 8 to java 11, also have upgraded all the third party jars which were vulnerable, and have migrated projects from Spring to Spring boot following the three-tier architecture.

*  also I have done an internship at coding Ninjas as a Teaching Assistant, My job there was to debug the code of students, suggesting them the optimal approach and algorithms for the problems,


*   in addition to that I have also done freelancing job in Chegg India as an expert for computer science, where I have solved more than 200 problems in computer science asked by students from all over the world.

* In projects I have created a Web-based Compiler, It is an implementation of Compilex module. It provides an interface to compile and run
your programs in various languages.

* Also I have done  a project on Employee database management system using Tkinter framework of python,this is a GUI application in python which supports CRUD(create, read, update,   delete) operations and I had created various widgets including Frame, Entry, Buttons, Labels etc. this also supports reseting, displaying and pritning the data of the employee. for backend I had used MYSQL.

* Also I have Developed a pet adoption website named ADOPET to encourage people to adopt stray animals.

* I have also done a mentorship program at Girlscript Foundation where I Mentored a group of students in building a project on a Library management system which was a C++ based software illustrating OOPS (Object Oriented Programming) concepts and supports CRUD operation, and is used to issue books which maintains the database in a binary file.

* Apart from studies I am pretty much interested in chess and I have also won gold medal in state level chess championship.

* I have also interned at sparks foundation as the web development and designing intern where I had developed a project on banking system.  the main idea behind the project was to make a website where a bank transactions can be noted down and a list can be maintained about your bank transacion, the tech stack which I had used were HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript and for the backend purpose I used MYSQL for maintaining the databse

Good morning sir/ma'am, I am currently doing B.Tech from University College of Engineering and Technology in Information Technology, apart from my curriculum I have done a paid internship at coding Ninjas as a Teaching Assistant, My job there was to debug the code of students, suggesting them the optimal approach and algorithms for the problems, helping them in finding the time and space complexity of their problems and teaching them how to think of optimal approach for each problem, in addition to that I have also done freelancing job in Chegg India, where I solved 100+ computer science problems from students all over the world, I have also interned at sparks foundation as the web development and designing intern where I had to build a website on the basic banking system using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I have also done a mentorship program at Girlscript Foundation where I Mentored a group of students in building a project on a Library management system which was a C++ based software illustrating OOPS (Object Oriented Programming) concepts and supports CRUD operation, and is used to issue books which maintains the database in a binary file.I have also done a certification programme from coding Ninjas in competitive programming where I was the top performer with 98.2%.
I also have done various projects including A GUI application in python which supports CRUD(create, read, update, delete) operations using SQlite and created various widgets including Frame, Entry, Text, Buttons, Labels etc. which also supports reseting, displaying and pritning of the data.
Also I have Developed a pet adoption website named ADOPET to encourage people to adopt stray animals using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.

Apart from studies I am pretty much interested in chess and I have also won gold medal in state level chess championship.

# Maven
* Maven is a build tool provided by apache software and it is completely open source
* without maven, you have to downlaod every jar file from websites one by one and then attach all these to your project and whenever you'll want to upgrade them, you have to upgrade one by one by removing them and installing one by one.
* Maven is a project management and comprehension tool that provides developers a complete build lifecycle framework. Development team can automate the project's build infrastructure in almost no time as Maven uses a standard directory layout and a default build lifecycle.
* Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. 

# Three tier architecture:
* Presentation layer
* Business layer(having actual business logic, @service)
* Data access layer(this layer is used to interact with data, @Repository)
