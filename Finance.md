# 1. Introduction
Hello, my name is Anjali Kumari, and I'm pleased to be here for this interview. I have completed my MBA in finance and my undergraduate degree in Accounts Honors from BSS College. My schooling was completed at DAV Public School. Along with academics, I have a keen interest in cooking and gardening, which I believe helps me maintain a balanced and productive lifestyle.

My strengths include my ability to analyze complex financial data and identify patterns that can help organizations make better financial decisions. I can convey complex financial concepts in simple terms that are easy to understand for everyone. In addition, my attention to detail and accuracy help me to ensure that financial records and reports are always up to date and accurate.

One of my weaknesses is that I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist, and I sometimes spend too much time on small details. However, I have been working on this by prioritizing tasks and delegating where appropriate.

In the short term, my goal is to secure a role that allows me to use my finance skills and knowledge to contribute to the success of an organization. In the long term, I hope to grow my skills and experience and eventually take on a leadership role in the finance department.

Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to discussing my qualifications and experience further during the interview.
